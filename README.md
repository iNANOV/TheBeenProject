# TheBeenProject 🐝💡📊  

**TheBeenProject is a research project exploring AI-driven trading strategies, inspired by bee foraging behavior. It is not intended for commercial use.**  

## 🧠 Research Concept  

Just like bees learn which flowers contain nectar through experience, this system explores how different machine learning models can identify the best trade opportunities. The core assumption is that **very good trades are often surrounded by other positive trades, even if they are not as strong**, similar to how flowers with nectar form distinct areas separate from vegetation that is not useful for bees.  

## 🚀 Key Research Objectives  

- **Binary Classification**: Investigate how trades can be classified as favorable or not based on surrounding patterns.  
- **Scalability**: Study how multiple systems (simulating a bee swarm) improve trade identification.  
- **Customizable Behavior**: Explore the impact of adjusting aggressiveness, sensitivity, and trade preferences.  
- **Continuous Learning**: Test how AI models improve over time with a growing number of tested trade combinations.  

## 📈 How It Works  

1. **Trade Representation**: Trades are structured like flowers, with various attributes acting as features.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Different transformations serve as the bee’s senses to analyze market conditions.  
3. **Model Training**: Machine learning models classify and optimize trade selection.  
4. **Adaptive Scaling**: The system is tested on multiple servers to analyze efficiency.  
5. **Risk & Pattern Analysis**: Research how trades cluster and how risks can be managed effectively.  

## ⚠️ Important Notice  

- This project is **purely for research purposes** and **not linked to any commercial applications**.  
- The focus is on understanding trade pattern recognition, **not financial gain or real-world trading**.  
- Results and insights are based on **hypothetical models and assumptions**, similar to how natural foraging behaviors are studied in biology.
